# C# - Challenge

This repository contains challenges made in Csharp designed to practice and improve my knowledge

**ACTIVITIES:**

  1 - Write a program that receives a character inputted by the user and determines whether the character is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, or a special symbol.
  
  2 - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
  
  3 - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

  4 - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The string consists of English letters, numbers, digits, symbols and spaces.

  5 - Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

  6 - Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
