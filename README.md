# C# - Challenge

This repository contains challenges made in Csharp designed to practice and improve my knowledge

**ACTIVITIES:**

  1 - Write a program that receives a character inputted by the user and determines whether the character is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, or a special symbol.
  2 - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
  3 - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
